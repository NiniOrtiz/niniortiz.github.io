## Who am I?
Hello! I am Nini Ortiz Vales. I am an independent Computational Biologist. I love studying  Morphogenesis, Regeneration , Cancer and Aging from the perspective of Cognitive, informational and computational sciences. Not forgetting the Molecular, Biochemical, Epigenetic and gene regulatory networks that are inseparable from the Bioelectric mechanisms that cells employ to sense their environment, compute synchonyzed decisions  that result in the development of an embryo , maintenance of the anatomy of a tissue , regeneration from an injury. And of course, how these control mechanisms break-down as we age.

## Where do I come from ?
 I was born and raised in Mérida, Yucatán México. I am affiliated with the Virology lab of the CIR-Hideyo Noguchi research center of the Autonomous University of Yucatán and The Youth  Science Association of Mérida Yucatán (AJC) which is a volunteer group that teaches science to  minorities and poverty-stricken communities and makes many science communication events . Within the virology lab I work with computational models of non-Beta DNA structures and their characterization. Within AJC I am in charge of workshops and courses that relate to novel areas of Bioinformatics and Developmental Biology. I am the founder of the Robert O. Beckerlab, which will be the first DIY-Bio community lab conducting research focused on the emerging relationship between bioelectricity, regeneration ,cancer and aging.


## Are you crazy? What do you mean by Bioelectricity?
I use Bioelectricity to refer to the transmembrane potential of cells. Every cell  has a transmembrane potential (Vmem) that given certain conditions can spike in a similar way to neurons and heart-cells. Yes! Even bacteria  and animal cells can produce electric spikes, the difference are the time-scales and the overall functions bioelectricity can have in cells and tissues. For example, in _Bacillus subtilis_ biofilms , the potassium ion channel-mediated bioelectrical signaling can attract distant cells to the periphery of the biofilm [1] and also nutrient-deprived B. subtilis cells in the interior of the colony use electrical communication to transmit stress signals to the periphery, which interfere with the growth of peripheral cells and reduce nutrient consumption, thereby relieving stress from the interior [2].  Animal cells use GAP junctions to facilitate the transport of ions and small RNAs, they are like little "straws" that connect the membrane of one cell to the closest in proximity. GAP junctions are very important for the establishment of Bioelectrical patterns. These patterns are generated by distinct regionalizations of ion distributions that in some instances precede the formation of complex organs like the eye in Xenopus Laevis [3]. Bioelectrical patterns also work in a similar fashion to morphogens because the electric potentials generated at the cellular membrane attract ion species, producing regions that have a more acid or basic pH, this as a consequence produces changes in the structure of the chromatin and the epigenetic machinery. Thus, changing gene expression. Which is why by studying the of bioelectrical patterns during regeneration or development we can begin to grasp the computational language of cells.


## Why Bioelectricity interests me?
-Because,during development and regeneration there are bioelectrical patterns that precede the formation of organs, they dictate the head-tail configuration (polarity) of  nematodes like _D.Japonica_ and are escencial for the correct patterning of the neural tube and creaniofacial features in humans and Xenopus laevis. When  _D.Japonica_  are cut in 2 the regions that will become the head and the tail will have a distinct bioelectric pattern. Bioelectricity seems to be ancient. Since, the last known common ancestor cell (LUCA) was theorized to have had ion channels and the diversification of metazoan life during the cambrian explosion correlates with the diversification of ion and voltage-gated channels as well with the emergence of animals with true brains . 

-Bioelectricity is also theorized to be used by cells as an efficient mechanism to convey,represent, store and process information. Which is why the study of the mechanistic principles and rules that make cells work togheter towards complex goals is in a sense fundamental to understand the cognitive basis of life.  These ideas are not properly my own, it was  inspired by the discoveries made by scientists I admire like Dr. Michael Levin, Dr. Adam Cohen, Dr. Gürol M. Süel, Dr. Alexis Pietak ,  Dr. Stephen M. Fuchs , Dr. Eric P. Hoel , Dr. Benjamin E. Wolfe, Dr. Jessica L.Whited , Dr. Michael B. Elowitz  and  many others.

## What is my aim?
-To undersand the role bioelectricity plays in the spatio-temporal representation and processing of information at the cellular membrane of cells, the execution of computational tasks, the integration and fusing multiple inputs at different scales of organization and  the generation of complex responses at the individual or tissue level. 

-To reveal why spatio-temporal regionalizations of ion distributions that are caused by distinct bioelectric patterns can alter the patterning of a tissue, the regeneration of an organ and the development of an individual. 

-To commmunicate to the local and regional scientific community about recent discoverys and dynamical models of Bioelectricity and their relationship with development, regeneration, cancer and aging.



## How DIY-Bioelectricity could help us achieve this goal?
From bacterial biofilms to human communities. When many individuals are focused in a goal it is not only more easy to achieve it, we can fullfil it within a shorter period of time. Nevertheless, at the time there is no grass-roots movement in the DIY-Bio  or Biochacking community that wants to tackle this challenge. For this reason I want to start such a movement, even if there are many challenges ahead I believe it is not impossible with enough determination and resolve .

## How can **you** help?
Join the Robert O. Becker lab or contact me! If you live to far away, you can also help by checking the future repos I will be uploading to my github and spreading the word!.
_Here I will list some ideas I believe we need to discuss and develop in order to stablish a DIY-Bioelectricity grassroots movement:_
- How can we guarantee reproducible research?
-What laboratory equipment and reagents we will need to build a DIY-Biolectricity lab?
- Under what guidelines, international laws and space-restrictions we will operate?
- What do wee need in order to acquire animal models in synchrony with international laws and standards that regulate their use?
- Depending on the animal model, What software  we  can implement or create to expand some areas of bioelectricity-related research? 




## About the workshop I gave about the  prediction of RNA structures in Datostada
![datostada](datostada.jpeg)
Within this workshop I talked about the importance of the secondary structure of RNA to many cellular functions and the relationship of the structure of the RNA and its function. I also used some code in a jupyter notebook format to introduce my students to how one can "predict" regions of RNA that could have more or less stability and why a stable RNA structure is important to viral genomes.
